# MongoDB $inc Operator Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The issue arises when attempting to increment a field that does not exist in the document. The `$inc` operator will create the field and initialize it to 0 before incrementing, which might not be the intended behavior in all cases.  This can lead to unexpected results and potential data inconsistencies.  The solution involves adding proper checks or using alternative approaches to handle cases where the field does not initially exist.

## Bug Description
The `$inc` operator in MongoDB, when used with `updateOne` or `updateMany`, will create the field and set it to 0 if it doesn't exist before incrementing it by the specified value. This is often undesirable if the absence of the field has a specific meaning in the application.

## Solution
The provided solution uses the `$setOnInsert` operator in conjunction with `$inc`.  This approach ensures that the field is only incremented if the document already exists. If the document is being inserted, `$setOnInsert` sets an initial value.  Alternatively, a check for the document's existence before the update could be implemented.
